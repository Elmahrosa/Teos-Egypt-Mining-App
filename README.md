# TEOS Egypt Mining App

🌍 **A Decentralized Crypto Mining Simulation Platform from Egypt**

The **TEOS Egypt Mining App** is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that brings Egypt to the forefront of the Web3 revolution. Developed independently by **Ayman Seif**, Founder of **Elmahrosa International**, this app democratizes cryptocurrency mining for Egyptian and Middle Eastern communities by offering a gamified, browser-based mining simulation. No expensive hardware or technical expertise required—just a smartphone or browser to mine virtual **$TEOS tokens**.

This project is part of the broader **TEOS Egypt ecosystem**, including **FPBE (Egypt’s first blockchain bank)**, **Egyptian Map of Pi**, and **Elmahrosa Smart City**, positioning Egypt as a leader in Africa’s decentralized technology landscape.

### 5. Implement Core Mining Features
1. Update `src/App.jsx` with the following code (replace the existing content):
   ```jsx
   import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

   function App() {
     const [tokens, setTokens] = useState(0);
     const [lastMined, setLastMined] = useState(null);
     const [referrals, setReferrals] = useState(0);

     useEffect(() => {
       const savedTokens = localStorage.getItem('teosTokens');
       const savedReferrals = localStorage.getItem('teosReferrals');
       if (savedTokens) setTokens(parseInt(savedTokens));
       if (savedReferrals) setReferrals(parseInt(savedReferrals));
     }, []);

     const mineToken = () => {
       const now = new Date();
       if (!lastMined || (now - new Date(lastMined) >= 3600000)) { // 1 hour cooldown
         const bonus = referrals * 0.05; // 5% bonus per referral
         const newTokens = tokens + 1 + bonus;
         setTokens(newTokens);
         setLastMined(now);
         localStorage.setItem('teosTokens', newTokens);
         localStorage.setItem('teosLastMined', now);
         alert(`Mined ${1 + bonus} \$TEOS tokens!`);
       } else {
         alert('You can only mine once per hour!');
       }
     };

     const referralLink = `${window.location.href}?ref=${Date.now()}`;
     const handleReferral = () => {
       navigator.clipboard.writeText(referralLink);
       alert('Referral link copied to clipboard!');
       setReferrals(referrals + 1);
       localStorage.setItem('teosReferrals', referrals + 1);
     };

     return (
       <div className="min-h-screen bg-egyptian-gold text-dark-goldenrod p-4">
         <h1 className="text-3xl font-papyrus text-center mb-4">TEOS Egypt Mining</h1>
         <p className="text-center mb-2">Tokens: {tokens} \$TEOS</p>
         <p className="text-center mb-4">Referrals: {referrals}</p>
         <button
           onClick={mineToken}
           className="bg-dark-goldenrod text-white px-4 py-2 rounded mx-auto block"
         >
           Mine 1 \$TEOS (Hourly)
         </button>
         <button
           onClick={handleReferral}
           className="bg-dark-goldenrod text-white px-4 py-2 rounded mt-4 mx-auto block"
         >
           Share Referral Link
         </button>
         <p className="text-center mt-2">Referral Link: {referralLink}</p>
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

## Notes
- This is a basic implementation based on the TEOS-NETWORK technical specifications. Enhance it with offline support, better UI/UX, and additional features as outlined in the document.
- Create and add the PWA icons (`pwa-192x192.png` and `pwa-512x512.png`) to the `public` folder, inspired by Egyptian cultural elements (e.g., pharaoh crowns).
- The OCR data in the document has some corruption (e.g., repeated text). Validate and clean the data if needed.
- For future enhancements, consider integrating Pi Network or adding NFT marketplace features as mentioned in the whitepaper.
