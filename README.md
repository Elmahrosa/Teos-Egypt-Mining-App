# TEOS Egypt Mining App

üåç **A Decentralized Crypto Mining Simulation Platform from Egypt**

The **TEOS Egypt Mining App** is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that brings Egypt to the forefront of the Web3 revolution. Developed independently by **Ayman Seif**, Founder of **Elmahrosa International**, this app democratizes cryptocurrency mining for Egyptian and Middle Eastern communities by offering a gamified, browser-based mining simulation. No expensive hardware or technical expertise required‚Äîjust a smartphone or browser to mine virtual **$TEOS tokens**.

This project is part of the broader **TEOS Egypt ecosystem**, including **FPBE (Egypt‚Äôs first blockchain bank)**, **Egyptian Map of Pi**, and **Elmahrosa Smart City**, positioning Egypt as a leader in Africa‚Äôs decentralized technology landscape.
